# Newlands
### *A digital tabletop game about staking your claim in an unknown territory! By making strategic investments, devious sabotages, and a little bit of market manipulating, you could be the next land baron billionaire!*

## Game Synopsis
Newlands is played in two main phases. During the "Buying" phase, players take turns buying tiles, the contents of which are unknown and shuffled. After initial tiles have been bought, players can then only buy tiles adjacent to those they already own. Once all tiles are purchased, the "Playing" phase begins.

The main gameplay of Newlands revolves around trying to balance maximizing the number of resources on your land, sabotaging other player's land, and manipulating the market to swing in your favor. So how does this work? The tiles a player owns can only support certain resources. Most tiles even come with their own resources embedded in them, and valuable ones if you're lucky! By playing modifier cards that add resources on to tiles, you can quickly increase your cash total! The catch, however, is that a resource's value isn't set in stone. Players can also play modifier cards on the resource market, and can quickly make the price of all that gold you found plummet! The idea of the game is the need to balance the types of tiles you've got with the resources that work with it, diversify your investments as much as you can, play the market in your favor, and sabotage other players to make sure they don't come out on top!

## Progress Report: October 2019

Progress on my October sprint checklist has been going very well. Many old systems have been successfully converted to the new flexible multiplayer setup, and I've even managed to sneak in some nice polish on some things!

#### Sprint Checklist:
- [x] Cards stack in new systems
- [x] Cards are redrawn in new systems
- [x] Clients are able to parse the new broadcasting system
- [x] The Game Setup screen now allows for more diverse game configurations
- [x] The "official" max player cap has been raised to 8
- [ ] Market cards are now functional in the new systems
- [ ] Player cash is calculated in the new systems

#### Stretch Goals:
- [ ] Reintroduce Card Foreclosures
- [ ] Reintroduce Card Upgrades

#### Extra Progress:
- [x] Cards and Tiles have animations!
- [x] New Turn/Round/Phase indicator GUI! I'm coming for the cash list next...
- [x] Aspect ratio tests with the new GUI that will influence later designs

#### Goals for the Future (Beta and Beyond):
- Dress up the game grid with a magically-expanding table and props that play into the "tabletop" design
- Create a final main menu that plays both into the tabletop design as well as cartographer look. I have plenty of ideas for a nice smoothly transitioning menu setup where you feel like you're moving to different ends of a table filled with maps and tools, but this will have to wait!
- Probably a different method of looking at your own cards as well as the market cards
- Tiles will be rendered differently at a distance to give more intuitive information at a glance, such as being color-coded with their type instead of owner, as well as contain icons for what resources they contain.
- Nicer final animations, especially for flipping cards
- Coast Tiles and a Fish Resource! These tiles will appear only on the edge of the grid, and will (hopefully) create interesting conflicts when choosing which tiles to purchase during the first phase
- Sound effects, and possibly a soundtrack?
- Usernames and the ability to rejoin a match in the case of an unexpected disconnect
- And more!

## Thanks for checking in on the progress of Newlands!
